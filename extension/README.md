# NotebookLM Citation Mapper

A Chrome extension that preserves citation references when copying chat text from Google NotebookLM.

## Overview

When you copy text from NotebookLM's chat interface, the citation numbers (like [1], [2], etc.) are included, but without context about which sources they refer to. This extension automatically maps those citation numbers to their corresponding source filenames, making your copied text complete and useful.

## Features

- **Automatic Citation Mapping**: Automatically detects and maps citation numbers to source document names
- **Source Snippets**: Pulls the quoted passage behind each citation into your copies and exports
- **Per-Answer Numbering**: Citation numbers restart at 1 in every answer, so each answer keeps its own source list
- **Copy with Sources**: Copy chat text with citation sources appended at the bottom
- **Draggable Legend Window**: Shows a real-time citation map directly on the NotebookLM page
- **Smart Citation Expansion**: Automatically expands hidden citation lists to capture all sources
- **Popup Interface**: Quick access to citation mappings and controls
- **Auto-Rescan**: Monitors page changes and updates mappings automatically
- **Customizable Formatting**: Configure how citations and sources appear in copied text
- **Export/Import**: Save and restore citation mappings
- **Statistics & History**: Track your citation usage and copy history
- **Theme Support**: Light, dark, and auto themes available

## How It Works

1. The extension injects a content script into NotebookLM pages
2. It scans the page for citation references and source documents
3. A mapping is created between citation numbers and source filenames
4. When you copy text, the extension adds the source list at the bottom
5. The mapping updates automatically as you interact with NotebookLM

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `extension` folder
5. The extension is now installed and ready to use

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Navigate to Google NotebookLM (https://notebook.google.com — the old
   https://notebooklm.google.com address redirects here)
2. Open a notebook and start a chat
3. Click the extension icon to see current citation mappings
4. Copy text from the chat - citations will be automatically included

### Source Snippets

NotebookLM shows the quoted source passage when you hover a citation number. That
text is already in the page, so the extension can read it without any network
request. Pick how it appears using **Source snippets in exports** in the popup:

| Option | Body text | Sources block |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Citation numbers only | `[1]` | filename only |
| Footnotes after each answer | `[1]` | filename + full snippet |
| Full snippet inline | `[1: file — "…"]` | none |
| Short inline + footnotes | `[1: "…"]` | filename + full snippet |

The choice is remembered and applies to plain copy, rich text copy, and PDF
export alike. Anything other than "Citation numbers only" has to reveal every
citation on the page to read its snippet, which takes a few seconds on a long
notebook; progress is shown in the popup while it runs.

### Legend Window

- A draggable window appears on the page showing the citation map
- Click and drag to reposition it
- Minimize/maximize using the controls
- Resize by dragging the corners
- Copy the entire mapping with one click
